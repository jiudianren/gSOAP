Expanded Remote command structure
存在两种变体  ；
#RSP 使用哪种变体呢？？




Two variants exist for the expanded remote command structure:
? The Command Scripting template is a BER-TLV data object as defined in ETSI TS 101 220 [5], i.e. it uses
definite length coding; see table 5.2.
? The Command Scripting template is a BER-TLV data object which uses indefinite length coding as defined in
ISO/IEC 8825-1 [21]; see table 5.2a.
NOTE: The variant with indefinite length coding is recommented to be used for RAM/RFM over HTTPS.
The tags of these TLVs are defined in annex A.




A Command TLV can be one of the following:
? A C-APDU, containing a remote management command.
? An Immediate Action TLV, containing a proactive command or another action to be performed when it is
encountered while processing the sequence of Command TLVs.
? An Error Action TLV, containing a proactive command to be performed only if an error is encountered in a
C-APDU following this TLV.
? A script Chaining TLV as first Command TLV.
